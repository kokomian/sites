<p>My phone was having ghost issue after one security/google update I don't remember. I used it for 2 years and then recently I installed a custom rom (pixel experience) by unlocking bootloader. Few days ago, I noticed that bootloader is still in unlocked state & I tried to lock it from fastboot menu. Horrible mistake was "Allow OEM unlocking in developer options is in disable state before I rebooted to fastboot mode. </p>
<p>Now the phone can't be booted because the OS installed is not Moto's genuine rom</p>
<p>And I'm stuck in fastboot screen & can't even flash another Custom rom because flashing & oem is locked now</p>
<br>
<p>I tried oem unlock with key but it doesn't work because OEM unlocking is disabled in developer options </p>
<p>I tried Rescue Smart Assistant RSA, but it shows "Connected device firmware doesnot match shipping software values & rescue cannot be run"</p>
